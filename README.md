# Welcome to my github profile!
### Here, I'll be sharing some of the projects I worked on in my free time.. Or any other cool repo I bump into.
About me: I'm a data scientist with IBM's Financial Services Segment, working with largest banks in the US in their data science projects. Doing a little bit of consulting, and a little bit of sales. Mainly focusing on IBM's Watson powered data science portfolio and enjoying every second of it.
