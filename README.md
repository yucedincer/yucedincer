# Welcome to my github profile!
### Here, I'll be sharing some of the projects I worked on in my free time.. Or any other cool repo I bump into.
About me: I'm a data scientist with IBM's Financial Services Segment, working with largest banks in the US in their data science projects. Doing a little bit of consulting, and a little bit of sales. Mainly focusing on IBM's Watson powered data science portfolio and enjoying every second of it.
Projects you see over here are my first projets that I've done, way before I joined IBM ~2yrs ago, but plan on adding new projects.
